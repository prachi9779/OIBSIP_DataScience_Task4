Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Task4_Email spam Detection using Machine Learning And NLP
# Email Spam Detection | Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship.
The task focuses on building a machine learning model to detect spam emails
using text classification techniques.

Spam detection is a vital application of data science
to improve email security and reduce unwanted messages.

## Problem Statement
Spam emails are unsolicited messages that may contain advertisements,
scams, or malicious content.

The objective of this task is to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham)
using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains email messages labeled as either spam or ham.
It includes:
- Email text
- Spam/ham label

The dataset is provided in CSV format.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
- Imported required Python libraries
- Loaded the email dataset
- Performed text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- Converted text into numerical features (vectorization)
- Built a classification model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and other metrics

## Results
The trained spam detection model successfully classified emails
as spam or non-spam with good accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project enhanced understanding of NLP techniques,
text preprocessing, and classification models in machine learning.
